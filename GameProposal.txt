Game Proposal:
3/7/2022

The game is a 3D

The player is walking down a corridor. The goal is to reach the end of the
corridor without dying. There are several obstacles that may prevent the player
from reaching the end. There are also characters that pop up and have to be shot
by the player in a limited time frame. The player must also be careful not to
shoot at anything because some of them will be 'friendly/civilian' characters.

It's a rapid game so the idea is to see how far the player can get in a single
round without being killed or without hitting one of the unintended objects.

The feeling that the player should have is tension but also one where they are
not certain which things are friendly and which are not.

Game Proposal:
3/7/2022

The game is a 3D

The player is walking down a corridor. The goal is to reach the end of the
corridor without dying. There are several obstacles/puzzles that must be solved
that may prevent the player from reaching the end. There are also characters
that pop up and have to be shot by the player in a limited time frame. The
player must also be careful not to shoot at anything because some of them will
be 'friendly/civilian' characters.

It's a rapid game so the idea is to see how far the player can get in a single
round without being killed or without hitting one of the unintended objects.

The feeling that the player should have is tension but also one where they are
not certain which things are friendly and which are not.


One thing in particular that I'd like to learn to implement with this is to
build some type of automatic level generating system. Rather than having to code
each discrete level, I would like to create a system which uses certain input
parameters to generate the levels as the game will be 'endless'.
